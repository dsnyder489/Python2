# Discogs API Read Me

## The goal of this project is to search for a musical artist and to get an album listing in return.

As a vinyl record collector, I use discogs.com to keep track of my collection and use the marketplace for purchasing new albums.
For this Python project, I chose to use discogs because it is something I use frequently.  As a Discogs member I was able to get
an authentication token, which is free.

## Developement Ideas
The purpose of this program is to gather a user input of an artist and spit out an album lsiting.  Future use can be expanded
so that a user can get more info from an artist or album.  This could be a faster way for a user to gather information instead of
searching through google or parsing through the data on your own.
